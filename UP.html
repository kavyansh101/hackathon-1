    <h1>UTTAR PRADESH :-</h1>
    <p>Uttar Pradesh attracts large number of visitors, both national and international; with more than 71 million domestic tourists (in 2003) and almost 25% of the All-India foreign tourists visiting Uttar Pradesh, it is one of the top tourist destinations in India. There are two regions in the state where a majority of the tourists go, the Hindu pilgrimage circuit and the Agra circuit.

        The pilgrimage circuit includes the most religiously prestigious of the cities considered holy in Hinduism on the banks of the Ganges and Yamuna, rivers which are also considered sacred: Varanasi, Ayodhya (in mythology the birthplace of Rama), Mathura (in mythology the birthplace of Krishna), Vrindavan (in mythology where Krishna spent his childhood), and Allahabad (Prayagraj) (the confluence or 'holy-sangam' of the Ganges-Yamuna rivers).[citation needed]
        
        The city of Agra is near three World Heritage Sites: Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri.[3] Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is cited as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". Agra Fort is about 2.5 km northwest of its much more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled palatial city. Fatehpur Sikri was the 16th-century capital city near Agra, built by the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great, whose mausoleum is in Agra. Dayal Bagh in Agra is a modern-day temple and tourist site with lifelike marble sculptures. Agra's attractions also include Asia's largest spa as well as Asia's second 6D theatre.[citation needed]
        
        Prem Mandir, Vrindavan, is called the "temple of love." Architecture, painting, music, and dance all flourished during the Mughal period (16th–18th century). Mughal architecture reached its height under the emperor Shah Jahān, who built the spectacular Taj Mahal at Agra. Paintings of the period were generally portraits or illustrations of religious and historic texts. Much of the musical tradition in Uttar Pradesh also was developed during the period. The type of music performed by Tansen and Baiju Bawra, contemporaries of the Mughal emperor Akbar, is still well known in the state and throughout India. The sitar (a stringed instrument of the lute family) and the tabla (consisting of two small drums)—perhaps the two most popular instruments of Indian music—were developed in the region during that period. The kathak classical dance style, which originated in the 18th century as a devotional dance in the temples of Vrindavan and Mathura, is the most popular form of classical dance in northern India.
        The state languages are Hindi and Urdu are prevalent in use. Several dialects of Hindi like Awadhi, Braj, Bagheli, Bhojpuri and Bundeli and sub-dialects besides the standard Khari Bholi are used by communities; the strong Urdu presence across the state can be attributed to the Persian and Mughal influences. Lakhnavi (Lucknow) Urdu is regarded as a superior literary form.
        A vibrantly rich art and craft heritage define Uttar Pradesh. Besides the Mughal stamp of architectural elegance in crafts like Pietra Dura, it is world renowned for black & ceramic pottery, brass artefacts, carpets, chikan work embroidery, fabric & metal zari work, glass artefacts, oriental scents and perfumes, metalware, silk fabrics, terracotta, wood carvings, and many more. 
        Indian cuisine has long been coveted for its astonishing variety of dishes and Uttar Pradesh is home to two of the most popular cuisines with a long history of culture and tradition. These are Awadhi and Mughal. The Awadhi cuisine is probably influenced by the Awadh region of the state; Mughal cuisine needs no introduction as many of the dishes created by the Nawabs feature in menus all over the world. The Biryanis, Koftas and Kheers are part of standard fare as well as customized for special occasions.
